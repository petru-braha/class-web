## week 3

- block vs inline display

- block == one below another'

- cascade(specificity, source order, importance), inheritance
- specificity: id selector > class selector > element selector
  - each selector has a score for
    - id
    - classes (also attribute selectors: "[]")
    - elements
  - specificity conflicts => iterate the matched selectors, see score 
- there are properties that can not be inherited

- css origin
  - external stylesheet = extra file
  - head tag inside the tag style 
  - any hypertag - style tag/attribute

- flex and grid (read about them) - floats chapter

- float cuts up the view port

- horizontal scroll - BAD PRACTICE
- tables - will enforce the horizontal scroll
